While I have been working at University of Economics' (17k students) IT Department I realized that whatever the issue is it is just my opportunity to learn more about the solution then. And that still excites me. I believe I have developed a domain-specific knowledge in finding almost all there is about user and system issues and to actively come up with solutions at the same time.

Thank you for taking my application into your considerations.

Yours faithfully,
Pavel Jurƒça
